    <h1>What Encourages You?</h1>
    <h2>Hebrews 3:13</h2>
    <p>The Bible calls for us to encourage one another daily but sometimes we don't know what enocurages ourselves 
        or what encourages the other person. This site is designed to make your life easier and help you
        find what those things might be. <br></br>
